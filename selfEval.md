# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?  
I am most proud of figuring out and remembering how to store the return value of a function as a variable. I'm also happy with using the rubber duck method to talk through some of my questions so that I used my own resources, googled for research and reframed my question to explain the issues so that I could resolve them myself.
- In your own words, why are functions a powerful tool in our applications?
Functions are dynamic machines built to custom fit a problem by the developer and capable of transforming data into products in an efficient way. There is a lot of functionality especially when building upon conditionals and methods in order achieve problem solving that is accessible and applicable to many other instances.
